-- Motor Control Checklist --

MOSFETs oriented correctly?
- Yes.

Sensor cable has pull-up resistors?
-Yes, 10k Ohm to 5v.

Way to turn off controller? Use switch to ground the shutdown pin on the switching regulator.  Zener!
- Yes.

Voltage sensor for batteries?
- Yes.  Uses Zener to drop ADC voltage to low end of battery voltage, then divider to shrink voltage range to ADC range

Voltage dividers for sensors that need them?
- The current transducers are the only ones that need them, and they have them.

Circuit protection devices in necessary places?
- One 77.8v TVS across the battery connections, and one 20v TVS on the control board power inputs.

Inter-board connection pins line up properly?
- Yes!

Unused pins on Teensy routed to external connections?
- The Teensy will be connected with stackable headers.  The unused pins can be accessed this way.

Inter-board header length is enough to provide clearance between components?
-  Yes.  Components are fairly flat.

Voltage regulators for control board able to handle planned voltage?
- Planned voltage is 12-17v.  The control board's regulators are rated to that.  Above that, will need external reg.

Separate ground planes are connected at one point?
- Yes, on control board.  No ground plane on bridge.

High-current/high-frequency loops are made as small as possible?
- Yes.  Switching regulator is fairly small.  Gate drivers  traces are as short as they can be.

Function indicator LEDs are placed on control board?
- Yes.  Red and green led for each of the half-bridge drivers, then an independent RGB led.

MOSFET drivers are connected to PWM outputs on Teensy?
- Yes.

Motor sensor phases are connected to interrupt-capable digital pins?
- Yes.  All digital pins are interrupt-capable.

Analog sensors are connected to analog pins on Teensy?
- Yes.

Motor thermistor has voltage divider set up properly?
- Yes.  R1 is a 2k Ohm resistor, which biases the circuit towards high-temp measurements.

Current transducers have all connections and capacitors?
- Yes.

SMD thermometer on bridge has all connections and capacitors?
- Yes.

Control board has reverse-current preventer to allow only Teensy to be USB powered?
- The 5v linear regulator has reverse flow prevention

All SMD components have silkscreen markings?
- Yes, on control and bridge.

All boards have name/date on them?
- Yes.

Pin connections are labelled if possible?
- Yes.

Teensy pins have a maximum of 9mA current draw?
- Yes.  MOSFET drivers are logic-level, and LEDs have resistors to limit max current to 2.5mA.
- Also, the 3.3v reg output is connected to only the motor thermistor, and draws <1mA.

Sensor cable pinout is correct?
- Yes.  Physically checked thermistor - 13k ohm at 22.9*C.

Decoupling capacitors on everything?
- Yes.  Capacitors across the supplies of all sensors.

Teensy is able to sense 5v supply voltage to apply correction to analog sensor readings?
- Yes.  Has voltage divider that cuts voltage in half.

Pin 33 is not connected to anything? (EZ Port pin, should not be used)
- True.

Switching regulator is connected properly?
- Yes.

Switching regulator is outputting correct voltage for linear regulator? (Allow for 500mV drop)
- Yes.  Voltage divider for feedback is set for output=5.5v.

Linear regulator is connected properly?
-

Regulators have all required components?
-

MOSFET drivers are connected to the proper hi and lo gates?
-

MOSFET drivers have appropriate power and ground connections?
-

All sensors have appropriate power and ground connections?
-

AGND is connected to a low-noise area?
-

All components ordering pages have been places in the bookmark folders?
-
